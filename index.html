    <h1 style="font-family: Nueton; text-align:center">Genetic Mutation to Fight Any Virus</h1>
    
    <p style="text-align:center">A rare mutation in the gene ISG15, could fight nearly any virus. About 1 in 10 million people possess this powerful mutation, which can fight off most (if not all) viruses that plague humans. Dusan Bogunovic of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, believes it may be possible to create a drug which mimics this rare mutation. If he is correct, he may be able to develop a drug could temporarily obtain the ability to fight off a virus, without getting sick.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Dusan Bogunovic recruited six people with this mutation, sequenced their DNA and isolated blood and skin cells.The researches then exposed the skin cells to several viruses. After 24 hours, their cells contained much fewer copies of viral particles than normal cells. According to Bogunovic's team, the ISG15 mutation prevents a functions which contributes  to the dampening of inflammation. Inflammation helps the body fight viruses, therefore preventing the dampening of iflammation, helps fight the virus easier and develops immunity before the virus can replicate.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center">Multiple Universe, Are they Possible?</h1>
    
    <p style="text-align:center">Multiple Universes...
Are They Possible?
You may have seen some fictional examples of distant galaxies and multiple universes, but this could be a possibility. There are a few theories of how multiple universes could exist:</p>
    
    <h2 style="text-align:center">Daughter Universe</h2>
    
    <p style="text-align:center">The "Daughter" Universe Theory is quite a popular theory. It consists of the idea that every choice we make can have a certain amount of outcomes for the choice we didn't make. It seems complicated, so here is an easier way of understanding it: Imagine you have been offered a job in another country or continent, and you can either choose to take it, or not. You could board the plane, or not, or you could reach the job, but decline it. In a nutshell, they are several possibilities and outcomes, however you would only obviously be able to choose one. Therefore, it is believed, that there are an identical universe to ours, however you choose a different option/outcome. Unfortunately, our universe is just under 14 billion years old, and therefore there cannot obviously be an infinite amount, yet a finite amount is still possible.
</p>
    
    <h2 style="text-align:center">Parallel Universes</h2>
    
    <p style="text-align:center">This one is a bit more confusing, but the basic idea is that there can be an infinite amount of universes, and they are exactly the same to ours, however they differ in one aspect or feature. For example, there could be a parallel universe where the gender, male, does not exist. So there is a universe for any and every possibility, however, like the "Daughter Universe" theory, there isn't an infinite amount of possibilities. It is actually quite an interesting theory, given that everything is possible, of course to extent of only one feature. It is a little hard to explain, so here's an extract of an article from Space.com:
</p>
    
    <h2 style="text-align:center">Eternal Inflation</h2>
    
    <p style="text-align:center">The theory of "eternal inflation" is based on research from Tufts University cosmologist Alexander Vilenkin. When observing space-time as a whole, some areas of space stop inflating. This is similar to the Big Bang where it inflated our own universe. However, others will continue to become larger. If we picture our universe as a bubble, it is sitting in a network of bubble universes of space. However, this theory is rather interesting could have different laws of physics to our universe, since they are not linked.
